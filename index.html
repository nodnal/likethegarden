                    <h4>A Bit About Reiki</h4>
                    <p>
                        Reiki (pronounced ‘raykey’) is an ancient healing technique discovered in Tibet thousands of years ago. 
                        Current Reiki practice can be traced back to 20th century Japan.Our entire universe is made up of energy, 
                        including the human body. Throughout the day our bodies are effected by the energy around us and we can become 
                        stressed, anxious, depressed, etc. Reiki practitioners direct universal or divine energy through their hands and 
                        into the clients body to create a natural sense of relaxation,well-being, and reduction of pain. When our bodies 
                        are calm and relaxed it is easier for us to heal.

                    <h4>What Does A Reiki Treatment Look Like?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Before we start your very first session we will take a few minutes to get to know each other, 
                        go over any questions you may have, and fill out some paperwork. *Don’t forget to wear your
                        comfy clothes to the session so you are already prepared for relaxation and you get the most 
                        out of the experience! When you are ready, I’ll have you will sit fully clothed in an anti-gravity 
                        chair or lay comfortably on a massage table, whichever you prefer, and I’ll play some appropriate 
                        soft music. It will be very similar to the ambiance of a spa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The session will begin with me placing my hands on or just above the body in various positions. 
                        If you have any specific areas of pain I will work on those areas first. Clients may experience 
                        a tingling sensation or warmth on the area being treated, even if I am not using a hands-on approach,
                        but the most noticeable effect of the treatment will be the deep relaxation and overall sense of well-being.
                        Oftentimes clients fall asleep during their session, showing just how relaxed they have become! 
                        Your first Reiki treatment will last approximately an hour. Future sessions can be anywhere from 30-60 
                        minutes depending on the clients needs.
